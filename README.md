# GPT3Tutorial

This is an implementation of an open-domain chatbot using GPT-3 pre-trained model from OpenAI.
prompt_chat.txt includes some text that gives an initial description of our chatbot, something like a personality.
You have to create (locally) a "openaisecuritykey.txt" file where you should include your API key from OpenAI's website.
